# project_reactjs_farm_fencing_website

This is the first project I made in react. A customer wanted a website so I decided to make it in react. The customer only wanted a simple website and the inspiration sites he had in mind were a little broken. This is what I came up with and he was very happy with the outcome. This project was very, learn as you go. I had completed a heap of random courses and it was time to test out what I knew.
